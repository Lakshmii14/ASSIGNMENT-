let arr1 = [];
let arr2 = [];

console.log(arr1 == arr2);  // false
console.log(arr1 === arr2); // false

When comparing arr1 and arr2 using == or ===, the comparison is by reference. Since arr1 and arr2 are two different instances, the comparison returns false.


let obj1 = {};
let obj2 = {};

console.log(obj1 == obj2);  // false
console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false

obj1 and obj2 are two distinct instances of empty objects. When compared using == or ===, the result is false because they do not refer to the same memory location.
